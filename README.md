 ### 1. Custom User Model
  ##### ↪️ Commits:
    • Custom User Model
        Important: Start custom user model from the very first migrate command you run,
        you’re in for a world of hurt because User is tightly interwoven with the rest of Django
        internally. It is challenging to switch over to a custom user model mid-project.
        
    • Custom User Forms
    • Custom User Admin
    • Superuser ($ docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser)
