 ### Getting Started
    ‚Ä¢ Setup Dev Environment
    ‚Ä¢ Initial Setup Python, Django, Docker, Postgresql
 #
 ### 1. Custom User Model
  ##### ‚Ü™Ô∏è Commits:
    ‚Ä¢ Custom User Model
        ‚ùóÔ∏è Start custom user model from the very first migrate command you run,
        you‚Äôre in for a world of hurt because User is tightly interwoven with the rest of Django
        internally. It is challenging to switch over to a custom user model mid-project.
        
    ‚Ä¢ Custom User Forms
    ‚Ä¢ Custom User Admin
    
    ‚Ä¢ Superuser ($ docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser)
        A good way to confirm our custom user model is up and running properly is to create a superuser
        account so we can log into the admin. This command will access CustomUserCreationForm under
        the hood
        
    ‚Ä¢ Unit Tests
        Testing Templates, Testing Creating User, Testing Creating Superuser
 #
 ### 2. Unit Testing
  ##### Django co-founder Jacob Kaplan-Moss, ‚ÄúCode without tests is broken as designed.‚Äù
    ‚ùóÔ∏è Django projects quickly grow in size where it‚Äôs impossible to remember all 
    the working pieces in your head working on a team, it is a nightmare to work
    on an untested codebase. Who knows what will break?
    
    Test Types:
        1. Unit tests are small, fast, and isolated to a specific piece of functionality
        2. Integration tests are large, slow, and used for testing an entire application or a user flow
           like payment that covers multiple screens
           
  ##### ‚Ü™Ô∏è Commits:
       ‚Ä¢ Testing URLs // SimpleTestCase
       ‚Ä¢ Testing Templates // status_code = 200 ?
       ‚Ä¢ Testing HTML // response contains 'Homepage' ?
       ‚Ä¢ setUp Method // set response to target so no longer need to define a response variable for each test
       ‚Ä¢ Resolve // views check can do is that HomePageView ‚Äúresolves‚Äù a given URL path
       
 #   
 ### 3. User Registration
  ##### ‚Ü™Ô∏è Commits:
    ‚Ä¢ Auth App // Implementing log in and log out using Django‚Äôs own auth app
    ‚Ä¢ Auth URLs and Views
    ‚Ä¢ Homepage
    ‚Ä¢ Log In, Logout, Redirects
    ‚Ä¢ SignUp and Unit testing 
    
 #   
 ### 4. Configure Static Assets Local/Production
  ##### ‚Ü™Ô∏è Commits:
    ‚Ä¢ static config - url,root,dirs,finders // static files configuration for production 
    ‚Ä¢ static files and collectstatic // production-ready directory of all the static files in our project
    ‚Ä¢ HomePage, static AboutPage
    ‚Ä¢ Django Crispy Forms // The django-crispy-forms provides a host of welcome upgrades
    ‚Ä¢ Testing AboutPage // Unit Tests
    
 #   
 ### 5. Advanced User Registration
  ##### AllAuth
    Django AllAuth is really simple to integrate into your Django project, Django AllAuth
    will provide you user Registration, login, logout, email update, forgot password, and 
    many more features already implemented and ready to use. Django AllAuth also does data validation
    
 ##### ‚Ü™Ô∏è Commits:   
    ‚Ä¢ django-allauth and Auth Backends // auth via e-mail too and django.contrib.sites
    ‚Ä¢ core mail backend // successful user registration emails to the command line console
    ‚Ä¢ built-in auth app URLs 
    ‚Ä¢ templates for allauth // allauth prefers they be located within a templates/account 
    ‚Ä¢ LogIn, LogOut, SignUp functionalities // {% url 'account_logout' %}
    ‚Ä¢ Email Only Login // settings.py
    ‚Ä¢ Tests for SignUp // django-allauth comes with its own tests. Tested only SignUp Page
  
 #   
 ### 6. Environment Variables
    Environment variables are variables that can be loaded into the operating environment of a
    project at run time as opposed to hard coded into the codebase itself. They are considered an
    integral part of the popular Twelve-Factor App Design methodology and a Django best practice
    because they allow a greater level of security and simpler local/production configurations.
    
    Why Secure? we can store truly secret information‚Äìdatabase credentials, API
    keys, and so on‚Äìseparate from the actual code base. This is a good idea because using a version
    control system, like git, means that it only takes one bad commit for credentials to be added in
    there forever. Which means that anyone with access to the codebase has full control over the
    project. https://github.com/Alimov-8/django-bookstore-app/blob/main/config/settings.py#L14

 ### 7. [Email Services](https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth/tree/master/allauth/) | [Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/email/)
 ##### ‚Ü™Ô∏è Commits:   
    ‚Ä¢ Confirmation Emails, Password reset/change 
        Fully configure email and add password change and password reset functionality.
        
  #      
  ### 8. Books App, List&Detail View, and UUID
  ##### ‚Ü™Ô∏è Commits:
    ‚Ä¢ Books App Models and Admin added
        verbosa name added to make admin panel understandable to client
        
    ‚Ä¢ URLs, Views, Templates, context object configs
        context_object_name = 'book_list' // object_list -> book_list: to make code clear 
    
    ‚Ä¢ DetailView with get_absoulte_url | pk,id,slug,uuid
        - get_absolute url
          reverse('book_detail', args=[str(self.id)])
          {% url 'book_detail' book.pk %} -> "{{ book.get_absolute_url }}"
          
        - id is a model field automatically set by Django internally to auto-increment
        
        id not ideal for a real-world project. There are two alternative approaches:
         
        - ‚Äúslug,‚Äù a newspaper term for a short label for something that is often used in URLs
          e.g. django-for-professionals. But The main challenge with slugs is handling duplicates,
          though this can be solved by adding
          random strings or numbers to a given slug field. The synchronization issue remains though
          
        - UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier)  e.g. books/4301d961-0531-4ed8-8cac-396325b1c20c/
        
    ‚Ä¢ Unit Tests
  
  
  #      
  ### 9. Reviews App, Foreign Keys
  ##### ‚Ü™Ô∏è Commits:
    ‚Ä¢ There are three possible types of foreign key relationships:
      One-to-one -> user profile
      One-to-many ->  one student can sign up for many classes
      Many-to-many -> each book could have more than one author and each author can write more
      than one book
    
    ‚Ä¢ Reviews App, Models FK, Admin TabularInline
    ‚Ä¢ Unit Tests

   #      
  ### 10. File/Image Uploads
  ##### ‚Ü™Ô∏è Commits:
    ‚Ä¢ Media Files Config:
      MEDIA_ROOT -> is the absolute file system path to the directory 
      for user-uploaded files
      MEDIA_URL -> is the URL we can use in our templates for the files

   #      
  ### 10. Permissions
  ##### ‚Ü™Ô∏è Commits:
    ‚Ä¢ Logged-In Users Only:
      login_required() decorator / LoginRequired mixin (class-based views)

      ‚ÄúBooks‚Äù link it will automatically redirect not login user to the Log In 
      page and if you somehow knew the UUID of a specific book page you‚Äôd be
      redirected to Log In as well!

  ##### üìÑ Summary:
     1. Bookstore project is now running with Docker and PostgreSQL and configured a
        custom user model. 
        
     2. Configured templates and added the first page to project, a static homepage.
        Also added tests which should always be included with new code changes.
        
     3. Bookstore project is not the most beautiful site in the world, 
        but it is very functional at this point.
        
     4. Static assets are a core part of every website and in Django we have to 
        take a number of additional steps so they are compiled and 
        hosted efficiently in production
        
     5. We now have a user registration flow that works and can be quickly extended
        into social authentication if needed. In the next chapter we‚Äôll add environment 
        variables to our project for greater security and flexibility
        
     6. Adding environment variables is a necessary step for any truly professional Django project.
     
     7. Configuring email properly is largely a one-time pain. But it is a necessary 
        part of any production website.  
        
     8. Bookstore project is now much clearer.
        Added a books model, learned how to change the URL structure, and
        switched to the much more secure UUID pattern
        
     9. Review app model added into books app,
        As the project grows it might also make sense to split reviews off into its own dedicated app.
        In general, keeping things as simple as possible‚Äìadding foreign
        keys within an existing app until it becomes too large to 
        easily understand‚Äìis a solid approach

    10. This chapter demonstrated how to add user files to a project. 
        In practice it is straightforward,
        but the additional layer of security concerns makes it an 
        area worthy of focus at scale.
